Academically, I am interested in neurotechnology, brain-computer interfacing, data visualization, statistics, machine learning, among other things. <br>
In my spare time, I go outdoors! I love to go on extended backcountry backpacking and canoe trips with friends. If you have any reccomendations for places to go I would love to hear them :D
