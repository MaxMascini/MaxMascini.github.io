If that‚Äôs not the case and you feel lost - feel free to reach out to me in the comments below, or through email - or read the quarto about/documentation here.\n\n\nGithub Copilot Summarizes Quarto:\n\n‚ÄúQuarto is a powerful and flexible publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows you to create beautiful and meaningful documents, reports, presentations, and websites using a variety of languages including Markdown, R, Python, and others.\nQuarto documents are plain text files that can include code, equations, and visualizations. These documents can be converted into a wide range of output formats such as HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Word, among others.\nOne of the key features of Quarto is its ability to execute embedded code chunks from multiple programming languages within the same document, similar to Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown documents. This makes it a great tool for literate programming and reproducible research.\nIn the context of creating websites, Quarto provides a simple yet powerful system for creating static websites from a collection of input documents. These websites can be easily hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, making Quarto a good choice for creating personal websites, blogs, project documentation, and more.‚Äù"

We also decided to do the trail north to south, starting in Topsail and ending in Cappahayden. While possible to carry enough food for the entire trip, we decided to plan and execute food drops at several locations along the trail. This allowed us to carry less weight on each section and plan our weight:calorie ratio more effectively."
