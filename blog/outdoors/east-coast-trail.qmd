## Introduction

During July-August of 2024, my mother and I undertook a thru-hike of the [East Coast Trail](https://eastcoasttrail.com/) - a 360km trail that runs along avalon peninsula on the eastern coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The trail is broken up into 25 sections, each with its own unique challenges and rewards. 


## Preparation

Many people choose to do the trail in sections, or thru-hike in 10-15 days. We decided to do the trail in 20 days, which allowed us to take our time and enjoy the scenery. We also decided to do the trail north to south, starting in Topsail and ending in Cappahayden. While possible to carry enough food for the entire trip, we decided to plan and execute food drops at several locations along the trail. This allowed us to carry less weight on each section and plan our weight:calorie ratio more effectively.
