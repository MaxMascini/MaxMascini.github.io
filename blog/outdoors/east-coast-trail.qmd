## Introduction

This past summer my mother and I undertook a thru-hike of the [East Coast Trail](https://eastcoasttrail.com/) - a 360km trail that runs along avalon peninsula on the eastern coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The trail is broken up into 25 sections, each with its own unique challenges and rewards.
