# Hello, my name is Max Mascini, and welcome to my website! 

I am a [Dalhousie University üêØ](https://www.youtube.com/live/3SxKIHY1dzI?t=5325s) first-class honours graduate in neuroscience and a certificate in neurotechnology & innovation. <br>

Currently working as a Research Assistant at the [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://www.ncilab.ca/) at Dalhousie University and a NeuroTech Programming Specialist at [SURGE Innovation](https://surgeinnovation.ca/). <br>

My research interests are at the intersection between the brain, technology and computer science but I also have passions for data visualization, statistics, and AI/machine learning. <br>

In my spare time, I love to go on backcountry backpacking and canoe trips. If you have any recommendations for places to go I would love to hear them :D <br>

Reach out anytime: [Mascini.max@dal.com](mailto:Mascini.max@dal.ca)
