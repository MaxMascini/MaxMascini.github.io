Hello, my name is Max Mascini, and welcome to my website! <br>

I recently graduated from [Dalhousie University](https://dal.ca) (go tigers!) with first honours in neuroscience and a certificate in neurotechnology & innovation. <br>

I am currently working as a NeuroTech Programming Specialist at [SURGE Innovation](https://surgeinnovation.ca) and as a Research Assistant in the [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://www.ncilab.ca/) at Dalhousie University. <br>

Currently, I am extremely interested in neurotechnology and brain-computer interfacing but also have a passion for data visualization, statistics, and machine learning, among other things. <br>

In my spare time, I love to go on extended backcountry backpacking and canoe trips with family and friends. If you have any reccomendations for places to go I would love to hear them :D <br>
